plan

display categories files
ask user to choose a category (0-3 inclusive)
if user chooses 1 then display all prodcuts containing the name
use: while line = reader.readline() == "Playstation" (example)

customer selects a product:
use the table technique to make user choose an option
keep making the user choose then end when they make an invalid option
invalid option can be caught if a try {catch} 
catch will have clear.console

display the selected items and their price (read from file somehow)
then add amounts... add items as you go along... use a counter to add ++ in the back then display the total amount
